- **Profile Data Fetching**: Retrieves user statistics from Codeforces API including ratings, ranks, submissions, and personal information
- **AI-Powered Praise Generation**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to create personalized, motivational descriptions
- **Real-time Submission Analysis**: Analyzes recent submissions to include programming languages and success rates
- **Rich Profile Display**: Shows user avatars, ratings, ranks, and other achievements

### User Experience
- **Modern UI**: Clean, gradient-based design with Tailwind CSS
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Loading States**: Engaging animations during data processing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for invalid usernames or API issues

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js 14 + React 18)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- **State Management**: React hooks (`useState`) for component state

### Backend (API Routes)
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/glaze-profile` (POST)
- **External APIs**: 
  - Codeforces API for user data and submissions
  - OpenAI API for AI content generation
- **Data Processing**: Formats and enriches Codeforces data before AI processing
