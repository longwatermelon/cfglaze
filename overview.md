# Project Overview: Codeforces Profile Glazer

## 🎯 Purpose

The **Codeforces Profile Glazer** is a fun web application that combines competitive programming data with AI-powered content generation. It takes a Codeforces username as input, fetches comprehensive profile data from the Codeforces API, and uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate enthusiastic, over-the-top complimentary descriptions of the user's coding skills and achievements. Additionally, it can analyze individual code submissions and provide similarly enthusiastic praise for the code's quality, algorithms, and style.

## 📊 Data Flow

### Profile Glazing
1. **User Input**: User enters Codeforces username
2. **Profile Fetching**: API calls Codeforces API to get user information
3. **Submission Analysis**: Fetches recent submissions for context
4. **Data Formatting**: Structures data for AI consumption
5. **AI Processing**: OpenAI generates enthusiastic praise based on profile
6. **Response**: Returns both original data and AI-generated content
7. **UI Update**: Frontend displays profile information with AI praise

### Code Glazing
1. **User Upload**: User uploads a code file (e.g., a Codeforces submission)
2. **Language Selection**: User specifies the programming language
3. **Content Extraction**: Frontend extracts text content from the uploaded file
4. **API Request**: Content and language are sent to the API
5. **AI Analysis**: OpenAI analyzes the code and generates enthusiastic praise
6. **Response**: Returns AI-generated evaluation
7. **UI Update**: Frontend displays the code evaluation
